# Poll Suggestion: Bitcoin Breakout Direction

## Poll Question
With $BTC currently at $84k, which level will it break first?

## Poll Options
1. Break above $90k
2. Break below $78k
3. Range-bound between $78k-$90k for >2 weeks
4. I'm just here for the results

## Rationale
This poll taps into market sentiment about Bitcoin's next directional move from its current price of $84k. The $90k level represents a psychological resistance and all-time high territory, while $78k is a key support level with significant on-chain activity. This type of directional prediction poll consistently generates high engagement as it appeals to both technical traders and on-chain analysts in your audience.

## Audience Insights Connection
Your audience analysis shows that your followers are particularly engaged with content about key Bitcoin price levels and market direction. This poll directly addresses their interest in actionable price targets while encouraging them to share their own analysis, which drives higher reply counts (one of your strongest engagement metrics).

## Content Plan
Based on poll results:
- If Option 1 wins: Create a thread about on-chain indicators supporting a bullish breakout and key resistance levels above $90k
- If Option 2 wins: Create a thread about risk management strategies and potential support levels below $78k
- If Option 3 wins: Create a thread about accumulation patterns and how to profit from range-bound markets
- If Option 4 wins: Create a balanced thread covering both scenarios with specific on-chain metrics to watch

## Optimal Posting Time
