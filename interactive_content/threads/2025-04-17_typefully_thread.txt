ðŸš¨ Bitcoin just survived a tariff panicâ€”and the on-chain data is flashing signals you canâ€™t ignore. Is this the calm before the next breakout, or a bull trap? Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s really happening beneath the surface ðŸ‘‡

---

Last week, BTC plunged to $74.5k on tariff fearsâ€”then snapped back to $84k after the US paused new tariffs.
But hereâ€™s the real story:
- Long-term holders are quietly adding (LTH supply up)
- Whales are taking profits, but NOT dumping (SOPR 1.06)
- Major exchanges are seeing BTC outflows = classic accumulation

ETH is still lagging, but SOL is bouncing back with strong inflows.
Macro backdrop?
- US inflation cooling (2.5% CPI)
- Central banks eyeing rate cuts
But market nerves remainâ€”next move hinges on macro headlines.
